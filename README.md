# FIFA 21 Random Match Generator

-   There’s nothing better than meeting up and getting one over on your mate on FIFA, securing that hard fought victory with one shot on target (compared to your friend’s 17) after parking the bus and taking your chance in that one counter attack. The only downside is that there’s no record of it if you play an offline Kick-Off Match...

-   It can get a bit repetitive always playing as the same teams in FIFA. This application solves that by allowing a user to generate two random teams for themselves and a friend to play with in a FIFA 21 match with the ability to create an account and track their previous results against their friends.

## Background

-   This is my first solo project after graduating from [futureproof's](https://getfutureproof.co.uk/) 13 week Web Development Bootcamp.

## Future Feautures

-   If you randomise to a nation with only one league, disable the randomise league button
-   Add in team star rating
    -   This would allow users to be able to randomise by teams of a certain star rating
-   The ability to filter your results on your personal dashboard by friends
-   Data analysis of results
    -   Number of wins against each friend
    -   Average number of goals scored
        -   When playing each friend
        -   When playing as teams of each star rating
    -   Average number of goals conceded
        -   When playing each friend
        -   When playing as teams of each star rating
-   Make the alert that pops up to tell you that you cant shuffle a team without having shuffled a nation and league more visually pleasing
-   Add in GDPR compliance
