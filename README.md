# FIFA 21 Random Match Generator

-   It can get a bit repetitive always playing as the same teams in FIFA. This application solves that by allowing a user to generate two random teams for themselves and a friend to play with in FIFA 21 with the option of signing in and recording their results against each of their friends.

## Background

-   This is my first solo project after graduating from [futureproof's](https://getfutureproof.co.uk/) 13 week Web Development Bootcamp.

## Future Feautures

-   If you randomise to a nation with only one league, disable the randomise league button
-   Add in team star rating
    -   This would allow users to be able to randomise by teams of a certain star rating
-   The ability to filter your results on your personal dashboard by friends
-   Data analysis of results
    -   Number of wins against each friend
    -   Average number of goals scored
        -   When playing each friend
        -   When playing as teams of each star rating
    -   Average number of goals conceded
        -   When playing each friend
        -   When playing as teams of each star rating
-   Make the alert that pops up to tell you that you cant shuffle a team without having shuffled a nation and league more visually pleasing
-   Add in GDPR compliance
